# ANPR

# Overview
This project focuses on the development of an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. ANPR systems are used for various applications such as traffic monitoring, toll collection, and security enforcement. The goal of this project was to create a robust system capable of accurately detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates from images or video streams.

# Objectives
Develop a system that can detect and localize vehicle number plates in an image or video frame.
Recognize and extract the text from the detected number plates.
Ensure high accuracy and efficiency in real-world conditions, such as varying lighting, weather, and angles.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tesseract OCR
Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

# Results
Achieved an overall accuracy of 95% in detecting and recognizing license plates on a test dataset.
The system demonstrated robustness against various challenges such as different lighting conditions, plate sizes, and occlusions.
